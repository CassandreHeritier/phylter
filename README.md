# Phylter, a tool for analyzing, visualizing and filtering phylogenomics datasets. 

**Phylter** is written in R language with dependencies on the 'ape' and 'Rspectra' packages.
**Phylter** relies on Distatis (Abdi et al, 2005), an extension of multidimensional scaling to 3 dimensions to compare multiple distance matrices at once.
In **Phylter**, the distance matrices compared are  computed either from the gene trees, or from individual gene multiple sequence alignements.
