\usage{
plotDistatisPartial(trees, distance = "patristic", bvalue = 0,
gene.names = NULL, method.imp = "IPCA", ncp = 3, center = FALSE,
scale = FALSE, maxiter = 1000, Norm = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{trees}{A list of gene trees in multiphylo format.}
\item{distance}{A method to generate distance matrices. It could be "nodal" to establish that the distance between two species is the number of nodes that separate them. Or "patristic" (default) if the distance between two species is be the sum of branch lengths between them.}
\item{bvalue}{This argument is only used if trees contain bootstrap values. It determines under what bootstrap values the nodes should be collapsed. Value 0 (the default) means that no nodes are collapsed.}
\item{gene.names}{List of gene names if the user want to renames the list of trees. NULL by default.}
\item{method.imp}{The method used for missing data imputation. "IPCA" for imputation with iteractive PCA (Slower but more accurate) ."MEAN" for imputation by means (faster but less accurate). If there is too much missing data in your data set the iterative PCA ("IPCA") method may not converge. Please then use method.imp ‚Åº "MEAN".}
\item{ncp}{only used if method.imp = "IPCA". integer corresponding to the number of components used to to predict the missing entries.}
\item{center}{only used if method.imp = "IPCA". boolean. By default FALSE leading to data not centered.}
\item{scale}{only used if method.imp = "IPCA". boolean. By default FALSE leading to not a same weight for each variable.}
\item{maxiter}{only used if method.imp = "IPCA". integer, maximum number of iteration for the algorithm.}
\item{Norm}{Type of normalization used for the function mat2dist. Current options are NONE (default) or MFA (that normalizes each matrix so that its first eigenvalue is equal to one).}
}
\value{
\item{constraints}{A set of plot constraints that are returned.}
\item{item.colors}{A set of colors for the observations are returned.}
\item{participant.colors}{A set of colors for the participants are returned.}
}
\description{

analysis.
