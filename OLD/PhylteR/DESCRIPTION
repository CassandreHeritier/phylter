Description: Detection of outliers in a list of genes trees. Detected outliers could be complete outliers 
    (genes and/or species) different from all the others. PhylteR can also detect gene/specie outliers couples
    (a leaf outlier in a particular tree). Phylter also use a missMDA method (imputePCA) to impute the position of
    missing species in gene trees. A web application of this package exists online at \url{lbbe-shiny.univ-lyon1.fr/PhylteR}.
